[Writing your own library] Instead of using the library implementation library.lib, write your own library (in assembly language) to support only the write system call to console. Your library code must extract arguments from the stack, check whether the request is for a console write, if so call INT 7 after supplying proper arguments in the stack as done in the previous stage. Upon return from the system call, your library routine must set the return value through the stack (setting return value in the proper location of the stack -see details here) and return control back to the application.
